### Predicting 2021 COVID cases using Time-Series from analyzing previous covid_19_india.csv .

In this project we analysed "covid_19_india.csv" dataset ,cleaned and visualized .


#### How to do a time series analysis?

    Step 1: Visualize the Time Series.It is essential to analyze the trends prior to building any kind of time series model.
    Step 2: Stationarize/Decompose the Series.
    Step 3: Find Optimal Parameters.
    Step 4: Build ARIMA Model.
    Step 5: Make Predictions.



#### So what is Time Series?

    1. A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.
    2. An observed time series can be decomposed into three components:
    * The trend (long term direction)
    * The seasonal (systematic, calendar related movements) 
    * The irregular (unsystematic, short term fluctuations).
    3. Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals.
